# sql_database
This is a SQL style database project that was the final project for a C++ data
structures class I took in Spring 2024.

It has functionality for creating different data tables with different fields
and inserting data points into the tables using SQL style commands and keywords. 
After creating tables, the user can access different tables of data and apply 
filters to appropriately search for a desired piece of information. 

Note: deleting tables and data is not part of the implementation. 

Implementation for the data structures and the rest of the project is found in
the "includes" folder.
