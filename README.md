# sql_database
This is a SQL style database project that was the final project for a C++ data
structures class I took in Spring 2024.

It has functionality for creating different data tables with different fields
and inserting data points into the tables. After creating tables, the user can 
access different tables of data and apply filters to appropriately search for a 
desired piece of information. 

Note: deleting tables and data is not part of the implementation.
